TitanicsEnd
===========

## Control System for the Titanic's End

To run, download [Processing2](https://processing.org/download/?processing), then open `TitanicsEnd.pde` and hit `Run`.

To contribute, look inside `Patterns.pde`.

To add a normal pattern (for most):
1) add your pattern to Patterns.pde -- follow format we already use
2) add your pattern to TitanticsEnd.pde (this is one line you add)
3) that's it.

Huge thanks to Mark Slee for putting together the framework.
